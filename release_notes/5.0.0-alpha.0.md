# Jasmine 5.0.0-alpha.0 Release Notes

## Summary

This release adds support for parallel execution and updates file glob handling.
See the 
[parallel documentation](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/running_specs_in_parallel)
for more information about that feature. Please also read the
[jasmine-core release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/5.0/release_notes/5.0.0-alpha.0.md)
for information about changes in that package, including breaking changes.

## Breaking changes

* Node versions older than 16.14 are no longer supported.
* Backslashes in the `specFiles` and `helperFiles` configuration properties are
  interpreted as the start of escape sequences on all OSes. Previous versions
  of Jasmine used a version of the `glob` package that treated them as directory
  separators on Windows and the start of escape sequences on other OSes.

## New features

* Support for parallel execution

## Supported environments

The jasmine package has been tested on 16.14+, and 18.
