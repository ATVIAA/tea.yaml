# Jasmine 5.1.0 Release Notes

This release updates the jasmine-core dependency to 5.1.0. See the
[jasmine-core release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/release_notes/5.1.0.md)
for more information.

## Bug Fixes

* Issue a deprecation warning if both jasmine.js and jasmine.json are found

  Jasmine incorrectly loads both files if they're both found. This will be
  fixed in the next major release.

* Fixed support for importing namespaced modules e.g. @serenity-js/jasmine

  Fixes [#199](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/issues/199)

  Merges [#209](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/pull/209) from @jan-molak

* Fixed config file detection when the Testdouble loader and possibly other 
  custom ES module loaders are used

## Supported environments

The jasmine package has been tested on Node 18 and 20.
