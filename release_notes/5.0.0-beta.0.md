# Jasmine 5.0.0-beta.0 Release Notes

This release adds the final pieces of support for parallel execution. There may 
be other changes before the final 5.0 release, but parallel support is now
considered feature-complete. Please
[open an issue](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine-npm/issues/new) if you think
anything's missing.

## Breaking changes

* Dropped support for Node 16

## New Features

* Added support for Node 20
* Parallel: Report unhandled exceptions/rejections that occur between spec files
* Parallel: `--parallel=auto` runs with an inferred number of workers

  The number of workers will be one less than the number of CPUs reported by
  Node. This is a reasonable default in most situations but may work poorly
  inside containers, since the number of CPUs reported by Node is based on the
  host machine's hardware and not the resources actually available in the
  container. Inside a container you are likely to get better results by
  explicitly specifying a number of workers instead, e.g. `--parallel=4`.

* Parallel: Support use without globals

  To use this feature, include `globals: false` in the options passed to the
  [ParallelRunner constructor](https://jasmine.github.io/api/npm/5.0.0-beta.0/ParallelRunner.html).

## Internal Improvements

* Updated to Glob 10
